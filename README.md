Hey guys!
This is a To-Do List mobile application created using React Native.
It is a very simple one page application.
The users will be able to add in tasks to the app. When they've completed the tasks, they simply need to touch the task to delete/complete it.
Prerequisite to run it on your mobile: Install the ExpoGo app on Android/iOS
How to run:
  1. Open the app in VS code
  2. Run npm install --global expo-cli (to setup dependencies for ExpoGo)
  3. expo init todoList (name of your application)
  4. cd todoList (redirect to your directory)
  5. expo start
  6. expo init
  7. npm start
       Then open the codeScanner for iOS or the ExpoGo app to scan the QR code.
